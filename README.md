# Platform Channels Example

This example shows the implementation of a Platform Channels, where the changes emitted by the GPS of the device are listened to.


### Documentation

* [Writing custom platform-specific code](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/platform-channels)




### Send data from client (Flutter) to host

Only the data types specified in the documentation can be sent. These are:
null, bool, int, double, String, Float, List, Map

```dart

await _methodChannel.invokeMethod(
          "version",
          {
          "product":"Apple pie",
          "amount":2,
          "price":3.5,
          "currency":"USD"
          }
      );

```

### Receiving data on host ( iOS / Swift)

```swift

let data : [String:Any] = call.arguments as! [String:Any]
let product : String = data["product"]

```

### Receiving data on host ( Android / Java)

```java

HashMap<String,Object> data = (HashMap<String,Object>) call.arguments;
String product = (String) data.get("product");

```
### To subscribe to the changes emitted by the device's GPS, the EventChannel was used.

```dart

final _eventChannel = const EventChannel("geolocation.listener");
_eventChannel.receiveBroadcastStream().listen((event) {
        
        });

```

### Built With

To communicate the client (Flutter) with the hosts (Android/iOS), Java was used for Android and Swift was used for iOS.
